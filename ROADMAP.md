# 2019/2020 ROADMAP

LAMIA is currently reaching a plateau regarding the developpment of new thematics. 
Even though we still have requests every month, we don't see much progress in the number of neede functionalities and we only adapt the GUI. 

Hence a focus on the new analysis of the data, which could benefit to all current users and not only the new ones. 

Q3 2019 : 
	Implementation of an automatic chart generator to use on the data collected
	Implementaion of an MCA tool to score the infrastructures of the databases
	Writing of the documentation (Finally !)
	Sea Dykes and public lightning ready
	SIRS connector

Q4 2019 :
	Optimisation for Qgis3
	Automatic generation of public work programs
	Optic fibre and telecom ready (?)

S1 2020 : 
	Improve I/O functions

S2 2020 :
	Progress on the GUI (especially on the field mode)
