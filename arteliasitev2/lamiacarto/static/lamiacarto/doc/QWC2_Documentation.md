# QGIS Web Client 2 Documentation

## Introduction

QGIS Web Client 2 (QWC2) is a modular next generation responsive web client for QGIS Server, built with ReactJS and OpenLayers.

It is released under the terms of the [BSD license](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Requirements

An working QGIS server environment is required. Projects which are to be offered as QWC2 topics must be published as WMS.

Furthermore, a web server is required which will serve the QWC2 application.

<!-- If possible, the QGIS server should run on the same scheme, hostname and port as the QWC2 application, otherwise additional measures need to be taken to allow cross-origin QWC2 requests see [Cross-Origin requests](#cross-origin-requests). -->

## <a name="quick-start"></a>Quick start

QWC2 is divided into two repositories:

- The QWC2 components, hosted at [https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/). This repository contains the core building blocks common to all QWC2 applications.
- The QWC2 application, an example is hosted at [https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app). This repository contains the user-specific configuration of the core components and can also include any other custom components.

Additionally, some QWC2 components (such as permalink generation, elevation queries, etc) require external services. Example implementations of such services are hosted at [https://github.com/sourcepole/qwc2-server](https://github.com/sourcepole/qwc2-server).

To work with QWC2, you will need a minimal development environment consisting of [git](https://git-scm.com/), [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

The fastest way to get started is by recursively cloning the demo application repository:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app.git

Next, install all required dependencies:

    $ cd qwc2-demo-app
    $ yarn install

Then, start a local development application:

    $ yarn start

The development application will run by default on `http://localhost:8081`. Note: if you are behind a proxy server, you'll need to [specify the proxy settings](#themes-json).

At this point, you can customize and configure the application according to your needs, as described in detail in the following chapters.

The final step is to compile a deployable application bundle for production:

    $ yarn run prod

You can then deploy the contents of the `prod` folder to your web server root. If you opt to deploy the application to a subfolder of the web server root, you will need to adjust the `assetsPath` and` translationsPath` settings in `config.json` accordingly.


## QWC2 configuration

The layout of the development tree is as follows:

These files are described in detail in the following sections, in order of importance.

### Application configuration: the `config.json` and `js/appConfig.js` files

The central aspect to keep in mind is that a QWC2 application consists of a collection of plugins, which can be individually enabled and configured, in particular separately for desktop and mobile mode. Together, the `config.json` and `js/appConfig.js` files control these plugins, along with a number of other global settings.

The `js/appConfig.js` file controls the following:
- Which projections are known to the application. Every projection used (as map or data projection) needs to be registered by adding a corresponding

      Proj4js.defs(<EPSG Code>, <proj definition>);

  line. By default, only `EPSG:4326`, `EPSG:4296` and `EPSG:3857` are registered. In addition, you can associate a human readable label to a projection by extending the `CoordinatesUtils.setCrsLabels` call. These labels will be displayed for instance in the mouse coordinate switcher. Alternatively, additional projections can also be registered in `config.json`, see below.
- Which plugins are built into the application. Plugins left out here will be completely omitted when compiling the application bundle, and will hence also reduce the size of the bundle.
- Which locales are supported.

The `config.json` file is the master configuration of the QWC2 application. It contains the following settings:

*URLs of external services*:
Some external services can be used to enhance the application. Sample services are available at [https://github.com/qwc-services/](https://github.com/qwc-services/). The following services can be configured:

| Setting              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
|`proxyServiceUrl`     | Ensures replies from cross-origin requests contain the CORS header. See [Cross-Origin requests](#cross-origin-requests).|
|`permalinkServiceUrl` | Generates and resolves compact permalinks for the Share plugin. If omitted, the full URL will be used. |
|`elevationServiceUrl` | Returns elevation values, used to generate a height profile when measuring lines and display elevation information in the map right-click information bubble. If omitted, the respective information will not be displayed in the client.|
|`mapInfoService`      | Returns additional information to be displayed in the map right-click information bubble. If omitted, no additional information will be displayed.|
|`featureReportService`| Returns a custom document associated to a feature. See [`themesConfig.json`](#themesConfig-json).|

*Global settings*:

| Setting                             | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
|`translationsPath`                   | Path from the webserver root to the `translations` folder.                          |
|`assetsPath`                         | Path from the webserver root to the `assets` folder.                                |
|`urlPositionFormat`                  | How to encode the current map extent in the URL, either `centerAndZoom` or `extent`. See [URL parameters](#url-parameters) for details. |
|`urlPositionCrs`                     | The CRS used to encode the current map extent coordinates in the URL.               |
|`omitUrlParameterUpdates`            | Whether to omit updating the URL parameters.                                        |
|`defaultFeatureStyle`                | The default style to use for selection geometries and other unstyled features.      |
|`projections`                        | A list of additional projections to register, in the format `{"code": "<code>", "proj": "<proj4def>", "label": "<label>"}`. |
|`allowFractionalZoom`                | Whether to allow arbitrary scales for viewing the map.                              |
|`localeAwareNumbers`                 | Whether to use locale aware numbers throughout.                                     |
|`wmsDpi`                             | The DPI to pass to the WMS requests.                                                |
|`wmsHidpi`                           | Whether to honour the device pixel ratio for WMS GetMap requests.                   |

*Global settings, overridable per theme*:<a name="config-json-overridable"></a>

The following options can be specified globally, and also overriden per theme, see [`themesConfig.json`](#themesConfig-json).

| Setting                              | Description |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|
|`preserveExtentOnThemeSwitch`         | Whether to preserve the current map extent when switching theme, if possible (see below). |
|`preserveBackgroundOnThemeSwitch`     | Whether to preserve the current background layer when switching theme, if possible. |
|`preserveNonThemeLayersOnThemeSwitch` | Whether to preserve non-theme layers when switching theme.                          |
|`allowReorderingLayers`               | Whether to allow re-ordering layers in the layer tree.                              |
|`flattenLayerTreeGroups`              | Whether to display a flat layer tree, omitting the groups.                          |
|`allowLayerTreeSeparators`            | Allows users to add separator items in a flat layer tree.                           |
|`preventSplittingGroupsWhenReordering`| Whether to prevent splitting sibling groups or the group itself when reordering items. |
|`allowRemovingThemeLayers`            | Whether to allow removing any theme layers from the layer tree.                     |
|`searchThemes`                        | Whether allow searching for themes from the global search field.                    |
|`allowAddingOtherThemes`              | Whether to allow adding another theme to a currently loaded theme.                  |
|`disableImportingLocalLayers`         | Whether to hide the option to import local layers from the layer tree.              |
|`importLayerUrlPresets`               | A list of predefined URLs from which the user can choose when importing layers from the layer tree. Entries must be strings or objects of the format `{"label": "<Label>", "value": "<URL>"}`. See also [Layer catalogs](#layer-catalogs). |
|`identifyTool`                        | The name of the identify tool to use. It is possible to have multiple identify tools, and i.e. on a per-theme basis select which one is active. |

*Notes*:

- The layer tree supports re-ordering layers via drag-and-drop if `allowReorderingLayers = true` *and either* `preventSplittingGroupsWhenReordering = true` *or* `flattenGroups = true` in the `LayerTree` plugin configuration.
- If `preserveExtentOnThemeSwitch = true`, the current extent is preserved if it is within the new theme extent and if the current theme map projection is equal to the new theme projection. If `preserveExtentOnThemeSwitch = "force"`, the current extent is preserved regardless of whether it is within the new theme extent, but the current and new theme map projections must still match.

*Plugin configuration*:
The plugin configuration is entered separately for desktop and for mobile mode. Refer to the [sample `config.json`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/config.json) for a list of available configuration options. Each plugin configuration block is of the format

    {
      "name": "<PluginName">,
      "cfg": {
        ...
      },
      "mapClickAction": <"identify"|"unset"|null>
    }

where

* `name`: The plugin name
* `cfg`: Optional: arbitrary configuration properties, directly passed to the relative plugin class as React props.
* `mapClickAction`: Optional: for plugins which are associated to a viewer task (and typically linked in the `menuItems` or `toolbarItems` of the `TopBar`, see below), determines whether a click in the map will result in the identify tool being invoked, the task being unset, or whether no particular action should be performed (default). Note: `"mapClickAction"` should be `null` or omitted for plugins which handle mouse events on the map themselves. Can optionally also be specified directly in the `menuItems` or `toolbarItems` entries, see below.

You can omit a plugin entry to disable it in desktop and/or mobile mode. To completely remove a plugin from the compiled application, remove the corresponding entry in `js/appConfig.js`.

A particularly interesting aspect is the configuration of the entries in the application menu and toolbar, i.e. the entries in `menuItems` and `toolbarItems` in the `TopBar` configuration. The most common format for linking an entry to an existing plugin is

    {"key": "<key>", "icon": "<icon>", "themeWhitelist": ["<themename>", ...], "mapClickAction": <"identify"|"unset"|null>, "mode": "<mode>"}

where

* `key`: The name of the plugin to activate when the entry is clicked, i.e. `LayerTree`. Also used to lookup the the label for the entry from the translations, using the `appmenu.items.<key>` message identifier (see <a href="#translations">Managing translations</a>).
* `icon`: The icon of the entry, either a name (without the `.svg` extension) of an icon in `icons/`, or `:/<path_to_asset>` containing the path relative to `assetsPath` of an asset image.
* `themeWhitelist`: Optional, allows specifying a whitelist of theme names for which the entry should be visible.
* `mapClickAction`: Optional, takes precedence over the `mapClickAction` setting specified in the plugin configuration block, if any. See above.
* `mode`: Optional, depending on the plugin, a mode can be configured to launch the plugin directly in a specific mode. For instance, the `Measure` plugin supports specifying the measurement mode (`Point`, `LineString`, `Polygon`).

Additionally, entries opening external URLs can be defined as follows:

    {"key": "<key>", "icon": "<icon>", "url": "<url>"}

where

* `Key: An arbitrary key name (not used by existing plugins), used to lookup the the label for the entry from the translations.
* `icon`: As above.
* `url`: The URL to open. Can contain as placeholders the keys listed in <a href="#url-parameters">URL parameters</a>, encolsed in `$` (i.e. `$e$` for the extent). In addition, the placeholders `$x$` and `$y$` for the individual map center coordinates are also supported.



### Theme configuration: QGIS projects and the `themesConfig.json` file

A theme corresponds to a QGIS project, published as WMS and served by QGIS Server.

#### Creating and publishing a QGIS project

The first step is to prepare a QGIS project. Besides the common tasks of adding and grouping layers, the following table gives an overview of settings which influence how the theme is displayed by QWC2:

| What                 | Where                                     | Description                                      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Service capabilities | Project Properties &rarr; QGIS Server &rarr; Service capabilities | **Must** be checked for QGIS Server to publish the project. |
| Title, keywords      | Project Properties &rarr; QGIS Server &rarr; Service capabilities | Theme title, displayed in the Theme Switcher, and keywords, useful for filtering. |
| Queryable layers     | Project Properties &rarr; Identify Layers | Mark layers as identifyable by the client.       |
| FeatureInfo geometry | Project Properties &rarr; QGIS Server &rarr; WMS Capabilities &rarr; Add geometry to feature response | Return feature geometries with the GetFeatureInfo request. Allows the client to highlight the selected features. |
| Layer Display Field  | Vector Layer Properties &rarr; Display    | The field used in the identify results. |
| Layer Map Tip        | Vector Layer Properties &rarr; Display    | The contents of the Map Tip shown when hovering over layers in the client, if displaying Map Tips is enabled in the Layer Tree. |
| Layer Metadata       | Layer Properties &rarr; Metadata          | Shown in the client Layer Info dialog, invokable from the Layer Tree. |
| Scale range          | Layer Properties &rarr; Rendering &rarr; Scale dependent visibility | The scale range within which a layer is visible, useful to improve rendering performance. |
| Initial visibility   | Layers Panel                              | Initial visibility of layers and groups.         |
| Rendering order      | Layer Order Panel or Layers Panel         | Rendering order of the layers. If layer re-ordering is enabled in `config.json`, the order from the Layer Order Panel is ignored. |
| Print layouts        | Layout manager                            | The print layouts offered in the Print plugin.   |
| Print layout labels  | Layout manager                            | Print layout labels with an ID will be exposed in the Print plugin. |

#### <a name="themesConfig-json"></a>Configuring the themes in `themesConfig.json`

The second step is to configure the themes which are available to QWC2 in the `themesConfig.json` file, which contains a list of themes, optionally organized in groups, as well as a list of background layers:

    {
      "themes": {
        "items": [
          { <ThemeDefinition> },
          ...
        ], "groups": [
          {
            "title": <Group title>,
            "items": [{ <ThemeDefinition> }, ...],
            "groups": [ { <Group> }, ...]
           },
           ...
        ]
      },
      "externalLayers": [
        { <ExternalLayerDefinition> },
        ...
      ],
      "themeInfoLinks": [
        { <ThemeInfoLinkDefinition> },
        ...
      ],
      "backgroundLayers": [
        { <BackgroundLayerDefinition> },
        ...
      ],
      "defaultScales": [<Scale denominators>],
      "defaultPrintScales" [<Scale denominators>],
      "defaultPrintResolutions": [<DPIs>],
      "defaultPrintGrid": [<Print grid, see below>]
    }

Refer to the [sample `themesConfig.json`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/themesConfig.json) for a complete example.

The format of the theme definitions is as follows:
<!-- Important: Use U+00A0 non-breaking spaces ( ) in code blocks -->

| `  ...`                                       |                                                                                  |
| `}`                                           |

**External layers:**
External layers can be used to selectively replace layers in a QGIS project, for instance in the case of a WMS layer embedded in a QGIS project, to avoid cascading WMS requests. They are handled transparently by QWC2 (they are positioned in the layer tree identically to the internal layer they replace), but the `GetMap` and `GetFeatureInfo` requests are sent directly to the specified WMS Service. Only WMS layers can be specified as external layers.

The format for external layer definitions is as follows:

| Entry                                                  | Description                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"name": "<external_layer_name>",`                     | The name of the external layer, as referenced in the theme definitions.           |
| `"url": "<wms_baseurl>",       `                       | Base WMS URL for the external layer.                                              |
| `"params": {`                                          | Parameters for the GetMap request.                                                |
| `  "LAYERS": "<wms_layername>,..."`,                   | WMS layer names.                                                                  |
| `  "OPACITIES": "<0-255>,..."`                         | Optional, if WMS server supports opacities.                                       |
| `},`                                                   |                                                                                   |
| `"featureInfoUrl": "<wms_featureinfo_baseurl>",`       | Optional, base URL for WMS GetFeatureInfo, if different from `url`.               |
| `"queryLayers": ["<wms_featureinfo_layername>", ...],` | Optional, list of GetFeatureInfo query layers, if different from `params.LAYERS`. |
| `"infoFormats": ["<featureinfo_format>", ...]`         | List of GetFeatureInfo query formats which the WMS service supports.              |


**Theme info links:**
You can specify links to display in an info-menu next to the respective theme title in the theme switcher entries.

The format for the theme info links is as follows:

| Entry                                                  | Description                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"name": "<link_name>",`                               | The name of the link, as referenced in the theme definitions.                     |
| `"title": "<link_title>",`                             | The title for the link, as displayed in the info menu of the theme entry in the theme switcher. |
| `"url": "<link>",`                                     | A link URL.                                                                       |
| `"target": "<link_target>"`                            | The link target, i.e. `_blank`.                                                   |


**Background layers:**
Background layers are handled completely client-side and do not appear in the layer tree.

The format of the background layer definitions is as follows:

| Entry                        | Description                                                                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"name": "<Name>",`          | The name of the background layer, used in the theme definitions.                  |
| `"title": "<Title>",       ` | The title of the background layer, as displayed in the background switcher.       |
| `"thumbnail": "<Filename>",` | Optional, image file in `assets/img/mapthumbs`. Defaults to `default.jpg`.        |
| `"type": "<Type>",`          | The background layer type, i.e. `wms` or `wmts`.                                  |
| `"group":  "<GroupId>",`     | Optional, a group ID string. Background layers with the same group ID will be grouped together in the background switcher. |
| `<Layer params>`             | Parameters according to the specified layer type. Refer to the [sample `themesConfig.json`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/themesConfig.json) for some examples. |

*Note*: You can use the helper python script located at `qwc2/scripts/wmts_config_generator.py` to easily generate WMTS background layer configurations.

#### <a name="themes-json"></a>Generating `themes.json`

The final step is to generate `themes.json`, the file which is ultimately read by QWC2. This file combines the input from `themesConfig.json` with the information from the WMS service capabilities and is automatically generated when starting the local development application via `yarn start`. Alternatively, it can be manually generated via

    yarn run themesconfig

or, if working in an environment without node, using the equivalent command

    python3 qwc2/scripts/themesConfig.py


If you want to manage multiple `themesConfig.json` files, you can specify which while should be processed by the theme generation script via the `QWC2_THEMES_CONFIG` environment variable.

Note: if you are behind a proxy server and your `themesConfig.json` refers to resources outside the local network, you'll need to specify the proxy settings to use in `themesConfig.json` by adding a toplevel block of the form

    {
      "proxy": {
          "host": "<host>",
          "port": <port>,
          "auth": {
              "username": "<username>",
              "password": "<password>"
        }
      },
      "themes": {...},
      ...
    }

### Implementing search providers in `js/SearchProviders.js`

Search providers are typically application specific, and hence need to be implemented in the application specific `js/SearchProviders.js` file. The [sample  `js/SearchProviders.js`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/js/SearchProviders.js) documents how to implement search providers and contains some examples.

An advanced feature is the possibility to define parametrized search providers. This allows for instance to implement just a generic search provider interface in `js/SearchProviders.js` and move the implementation details to the service. To this end, you can also add to the `searchProviders` list in `themesConfig.json` entries of the form

    {key: <Key>, label: <Label>, ...}

Such entries are passed to the method `searchProviderFactory` in `js/SearchProviders.js`, which you can tweak to dynamically create a search provider definition based on the parameters specified in the entry. Refer to the [sample  `js/SearchProviders.js`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/js/SearchProviders.js) for an example.

### <a name="editing-interface"></a>Implementing the editing interface in `js/EditingInterface.js`

The QWC2 Editing plugin allows to add, remove and edit features from the map. For this to work, however, the following steps need to be performed:

- The Editing plugin needs to be enabled in `config.json` and `appConfig.js`.
- The interface to the service responsible for writing the changes to the datasets needs to be implemented in `js/EditingInterface.js`.
- For every theme for which editing is allowed, a matching `editConfig.json` needs to be implemented and specified in the corresponding entry in `themesConfig.json`.

A skeleton for the interface to the editing service is provided in the [sample `js/EditingInterface.js`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/js/EditingInterface.js). The actual implementation is service specific.

The format of the `editConfig.json` is as follows:

| Entry                               | Description                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{`                                 |                                                               |
| `  <LayerId>: {`                    | A WMS layer ID. Should be a theme WMS layer name, to ensure the WMS is correctly refreshed. |
| `    "layerName": "<LayerName>",`   | The layer name to show in the selection combo box. |
| `    "geomType": "<GeomType>",`     | The geometry type, either `Point`, `LineString` or `Polygon`. |
| `    "displayField":  "<FieldId">",`| The ID of the field to use in the feature selection menu.     |
| `    "fields": [{`                  | A list of field definitions, for each exposed attribute.      |
| `      "id": "<FieldID>",`          | The field ID.                                                 |
| `      "name": "<FieldName>",`      | The field name, as displayed in the editing form.             |
| `      "type": "<FieldType>",`      | A field type. Either `bool`, `list` or a regular [HTML input element type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input). |
| `      "constraints": {`            | Constraints for the input field.                              |
| `        "values": [<Entries>],`    | Only if `type` is `list`: an array of arbitrary strings.      |
| `        ...`                       | For regular HTML input types, the ReactJS API name of any applicable [HTML input constraint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input), i.e. `maxLength` or `readOnly`. |
| `      }`                           |                                                               |
| `    }],`                           |                                                               |
| `    "form": "<PathToUiFile>",`     | As alternative to `fields`, a QtDesigner UI file. See below.  |
| `  }`                               |                                                               |
| `}`                                 |                                                               |

* If you specify `fields`, a simple form is autogenerated based on the field definitions.
* If you specify `form`, you can specify the URL to a Qt Designer UI form (use `:/<path>` to specify a path below the `assets` folder). Most basic input elements provided by QtDesigner are supported, see [this sample form](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/assets/forms/form.ui). The widget names must be set equal to the attribute names.

See the [sample `editConfig.json`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/test2056_edit.json) for a full example.

### <a name="translations"></a>Managing translations

The translations are managed on two levels:

- At QWC2 components level, in `qwc2/translations`.
- At application level, in `translations`.

A script will take care of merging the component translations into the application translations. This way, when updating the QWC2 submodule, new translations are automatically obtained. This script is automatically invoked on `yarn start`, but can also be manually invoked using

    yarn run tsupdate

Translations are stored inside the respective `translations` folder as regular plain-text JSON files, named `data.<locale>` and can be freely edited with any text editor.

The `tsconfig.json` files stored inside the respective `translations` folder contains the list of languages for which translations should be generated and a list of message IDs to include in the translation. The `tsupdate` script will read this file to automatically create resp. update the translation files.

In some cases, it is desired to override a translation inherited from the QWC2 components at application level. To prevent `tsupdate` from continuously reverting the overridden translation, the respective message IDs can be added to the `overrides` section in the application `tsconfig.json` file.

The typical workflow for managing application translations is:

- Declare all locales which should be supported in `js/appConfig.js`.
- Ensure these locales are listed in `translations/tsconfig.json`.
- Add message IDs of any custom components (which are not part of the common QWC2 components) in `translations/tsconfig.json`.
- Write the translated strings to the respective `data.<locale>` files.
- Test the translation, specifying `locale=<locale>` in the QWC2 application URL.

If translations of the QWC2 components for a desired language are missing, please create resp. update the translations respective files in `qwc2/translations` and contribute them by submitting a pull request to the [upstream qwc2 repository](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2).

### <a name="appearance-customization"></a>Customizing the QWC2 appearance

The following options are available for customizing the appearance of the QWC2 application while preserving compatibility with the core QWC2 components:

- Modifying the logo in `assets/img/`.
- Modifying the application icons in `icons`.
- Tweaking the colors in `styleConfig.js`.
- Adding style declarations to the master CSS stylesheet `assets/css/qwc2.css`. This however is potentially fragile and should only be done as a last resort.
- Changing the browser page title in `index.html`, and potentially adding a favicon.
- Modifying the legend print template in `assets/templates/legendprint.html`. The only requirement for this template is that is must contain a `<div id="legendcontainer"></div>` element.
- Modifying the custom Help component `js/Help.jsx`.

*Note*: The common application icons are located in `qwc2/icons`. They can be overridden by creating an icon with the same filename in the application specific `icons` folder.
*Note*: The icons in the `icons` folder are compiled into an icon font. Currently, the icons need to be black content on transparent background, and all drawings (including texts) must be converted to paths for the icons to render correctly.


## Server-side configuration
### <a name="cross-origin-requests"></a>Cross-Origin requests
All modern browsers will block a page from requesting resources from another origin (except for images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes and videos), unless the response from the remote origin contains a matching `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. An origin is defined as `<scheme>://<hostname>:<port>`.

For each service QWC2 interacts with, in particular the QGIS Server, one has to ensure that this interaction isn't blocked by the browser. The following options exist:

- Ensure that the service runs on the same origin as the web server which serves the QWC2 application.
- Ensure that the service sends a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with matching origin with each response.
- Use a proxy service which ensures the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` are added. The URL to this service needs to be specified as `proxyServiceUrl` in the `config.json` file. A sample implementation of such a proxy service is available [in the qwc2-server repository](https://github.com/sourcepole/qwc2-server).

### Filenames of print and raster and DXF export
The QGIS server response for the print, raster and DXF export requests does by default not contain any `Content-Disposition` header, meaning that browsers will attempt to guess a filename, which typically is the last part of the URL, without any extension.

To ensure browser use a proper filename, the following options exist:

- Configure the web server running QGIS Server to add a suitable `Content-Disposition` header to the response. In the case of Apache, the rule for the print output might look as follows:

      SetEnvIf Request_URI "^/wms.*/(.+)$" project_name=$1
      Header always setifempty Content-Disposition "attachment; filename=%{project_name}.pdf" "expr=%{CONTENT_TYPE} = 'application/pdf'"

  This rule will use the last part of the URL as basename and add the `.pdf` extension, and will also ensure that the content-type is set to `application/pdf`. Note that this example uses the `setenvif` and `headers` apache modules.
- Use a proxy service which adds a `Content-Disposition` header if necessary. QWC2 helps in this regard by automatically adding a `filename=<filename>` query parameter if `proxyServiceUrl` is set in `config.json` for requests which are expected to return a downloadable file. See the sample proxy service [in the qwc2-server repository](https://github.com/sourcepole/qwc2-server) for details.

## <a name="url-parameters"></a>URL parameters
The following parameters can appear in the URL of the QWC2 application:

- `t`: The active theme
- `l`: The layers in the map, see below.
- `bl`: The visible background layer
- `st`: The search text
- `e`: The visible extent
- `c`: The center of the visible extent
- `s`: The current scale
- `crs`: The CRS of extent/center coordinates
- `hc`: If `c` is specified and `hc` is `true` or `1`, a marker is set at `c` when starting the application. Note: requires the `StartupMarkerPlugin` plugin to be active.

The `l` parameter lists all layers in the map (redlining and background layers) as a comma separated list of entries of the form

    <layername>[<transparency>]!

where
- `layername` is the WMS name of a theme layer or group, or a string of the format

      <wms|wfs>:<service_url>#<layername>
   for external layers, i.e. `wms:https://wms.geo.admin.ch/?#ch.are.bauzonen`.
- `<transparency>` denotes the layer transparency, betwen 0 and 100. If the `[<transparency>]` portion is omitted, the layer is fully opaque.
- `!` denotes that the layer is invisible. If omitted, the layer is visible.

*Note*: If group name is specified instead of the layer name, QWC2 will automatically resolve this to all layer names contained in that group, and will apply transparency and visibility settings as specified for the group.

The `urlPositionFormat` parameter in `config.json` determines whether the extent or the center and scale appears in the URL.

The `urlPositionCrs` parameter in `config.json` determines the projection to use for the extent resp. center coordinates in the URL. By default the map projection of the current theme is used. If `urlPositionCrs` is equal to the map projection, the `crs` parameter is omitted in the URL.

If the search text passed via `st` results in a unique result, the viewer automatically zooms to this result on startup. If the search result does not provide a bounding box, the `minScale` defined in the `searchOptions` of the `TopBar` configuration in `config.json` is used.

## Startup position
By default, the viewer opens zooming on the respective theme extent, as defined in `themes.json` (and overrideable in `themesConfig.json`).

Alternatively, the following three options exist to influence the startup position:

- Pass appropriate `c`, `s` or `e` URL parameters, as documented in [URL parameters](#url-parameters).
- Pass a search text which results in a unique result (i.e. a coordinate string) as URL parameter, as documented in [URL parameters](#url-parameters).
- Set `startupMode` in the `LocateSupport` options of the `Map` configuration in `config.json`. Possible values are `DISABLED`, `ENABLED` or `FOLLOWING`. If a search text is passed via `st` URL parameter or `hc=1` is specified in the URL, the `startupMode` is ignored.

### <a name="layer-catalogs"></a>Layer catalogs
The import layer functionality in the layertree also supports loading a layer catalog document from an URL. Two catalog formats are supported:

* QGIS WMS/WFS connections XML: this file is produced by exporting the configured WMS or WFS connections from the QGIS data source manager dialog.
* JSON: a document with contents

      "catalog": {
        [
          {
            "title": "<Titel>",
            "resource": "<wms|wfs>:<service_url>#<layername>"
          },
        ...
        ]
      }

  where `resource` is in the same format as the serialized layer identifiers in a QWC2 URL, see [URL Parameters](#url-parameters).

Note that the server serving the catalog documents needs to ensure that it sets CORS headers appropriately, if they are served from a different origin than QWC2.


## Keeping the QWC2 application up to date
As mentioned in the [quick start](#quick-start) chapter, QWC2 is split into a common components repository and an application specific repository. The goal of this approach is to cleanly separate user-specific configuration and components which common components which serve as a basis for all QWC2 applications, and to make it as easy as possible to rebase the application onto the latest common QWC2 components.

The recommended workflow is to keep the `qwc2` folder a submodule referencing the [upstream qwc2 repository](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2). To update it, just checkout the desired tag, i.e.:

    cd qwc2
    git fetch
    git checkout <tag>

or update to the latest `master`, i.e.:

    cd qwc2
    git checkout master
    git pull

The [ChangeLog in the demo application repository](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) documents major changes, and in particular all incompatible changes between releases which require changes to the application specific code and/or configuration.

## Developing
QWC2 is written in JavaScript using in particular the ReactJS, Redux and OpenLayers libraries. The following links point to some useful resources to learn the basics:
