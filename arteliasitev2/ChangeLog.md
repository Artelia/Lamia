**Incompatible changes**:

- `exportFormat` has been replaced by `enableExport` in the Identify plugin configuration parameters in config.json
- The `qwc2` submodule is now registered as a yarn workspace dependency (see [`package.json`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/package.json)), all it's dependencies were moved to `qwc2/package.json`. The `webpack.config.js` also needs to be updated, see commit [6ff4ce0](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/commit/6ff4ce04b19043933ad177772eff21f45d721963). At the same time, the MapStore2 and QWC2Components trees were merged in the qwc2 submdoule.
- The `qwc2-icons.css` stylesheet isn't loaded anymore by the `Icon.jsx` component in the `qwc2` submodule, but needs to be referenced in the application specific code, for instance by adding to `js/app.jsx`

      require('../icons/build/qwc2-icons.css');

- The `Redlining` plugin import in `appConfig.js` must be invoked as a function, with the enabled plugins as argument
- The layer order in the `l` parameter is now consistently top-to-bottom, instead of the previous hybrid order (bottom-to-top for theme sublayers, top-to-bottom for external layers). To preserve compatibility of the theme sublayer ordering when restoring permalinks created with a previous application version, you can set `urlReverseLayerOrder: true` in `config.json`. This will however result in reversed order for external layers.
- `webpack.config.js` needs to be updated to handle `.mjs` files, see [this commit](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/commit/f954403d51f874c8a9f61c452e4840919874c6ec#diff-11e9f7f953edc64ba14b0cc350ae7b9d)
- The identify viewer now assumes by default that the QGIS Server will return the technical layer names (instead of the titles) in the GetFeatureInfo responses. If that is not the case, set `"featureInfoReturnsLayerName": false` in the Identify configuration parameters in `config.json`.
- Overriding the initial GPS positioning mode should be done in config.json (LocateSupport -> startupMode) rather than tweaking the default application state in appConfig.js
- Identify isn't automatically enabled anymore while the Layers panel is open. You need to explicitly set `"mapClickAction": "identify"` in the corresponding `menuItems` and/or `toolbarItems` configuration in `config.json`, as in the sample [`config.json`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/config.json).
- `identifyEnabled` in the `menuItems` and `toolbarItems` items is deprecated, use `"mapClickAction": "identify"`.
- The `LayersButton` is replaced by the more generic `TaskButton`, see the sample [`config.json`](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/config.json).
- The `proxyServiceUrl` in `config.json` is no longer supported, and `ProxyUtils` has been removed. Usage of `ProxyUtils.addProxyIfNeeded` in `SearchProviders.js` and `EditingInterface.js` needs to be removed. (Usage of `ProxyUtils.addProxyIfNeeded` was never complete in QWC2 and worked only for a fraction of calls, for development purposes, use a CORS plugin instead).

**Incompatible changes**:

- Keys of TopBar menuItems in config.js have been renamed
- Center/extent coordinates in URL by default in map projection instead of EPSG:4326
- The search text URL parameter key is now `st` instead of `s`
- The individual TopBar plugin components are now configured in js/appConfig.js
- The coordinate search provider was moved to js/SearchProviders.js
- The search providers onSearch and getMoreResults take an additional requestId argument
- The searchResultsLoaded action has changed:

        -const {searchResultLoaded} = require("../qwc2/MapStore2/web/client/actions/search");
        +const {addSearchResults} = require("../qwc2/QWC2Components/actions/search");

- The search providers must return the additional fields provider and reqId:

        {data: results, provider: providerId, reqId: requestId}

- Various scripts have been moved to qwc2/scripts. The "scripts" section of package.json has been adapted to use these.
- The translations/updateTranslations.py was removed in favour of qwc2/scripts/updateTranslations.js, the translation  languages now need to be specified in translations/tsconfig.json along with application specific message ids. Consult the README for more details.
- Map projections are now set individually for each theme via the mapCrs entry. If unset, it will default to EPSG:3857.
- The defaultScales list in themesConfig.json is now required
- The locale definitions under `supportedLocales` in `appConfig.js` must provide a localeData field

        localeData: require('react-intl/locale-data/<lang>')
- The print legend functionality requires a assets/templates/legendprint.html file with an element with id="legendcontainer", which will contain the legend graphics. The HTML document title of this template **may** influence the suggested output name when printing to a file (depending on the browser).
- The enabled MapPlugin components need to be specified in appConfig.js
- The custom extent in themesConfig.json needs to be specified w.r.t. the crs specified in the theme mapCrs
- Ported react components to use class definition and ES7 syntax, see i.e. [https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/06/07/react-on-es6-plus](https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/06/07/react-on-es6-plus). **Any custom react components will need to be updated**.
- Most of the logic in js/app.jsx was moved to the core components, the file needs to be updated according to the latest version in qwc2-demo-app
- The stylesheet assets/css/qwc2.css needs to be updated to include the style for `#container`, accoding to the latest version in qwc2-demo-app
- The npm packages are now used for openlayers and proj4. The corresponding `link` and `script` lines need to be removed from `index.html`, and in `js/appConfig.js` the proj import needs to be changed to `const Proj4js = require('proj4').default;`. Also, the following line needs to be removed from webpack.config.js:

      new webpack.NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(/proj4$/, path.join(__dirname, "qwc2", "libs", "proj4")),

- `qwc2serverUrl` in `config.json` was renamed to `permalinkServiceUrl` for clarity
- `proxyUrl` in `config.json` was renamed to `proxyServiceUrl` for clarity, and is now only the base URL without `url` query parameter
- The codebase now consistently uses `[x, y]` as point format (instead of a mix of `{x: x, y: y}` and `[x, y]`). So i.e. CoordinatesUtils.reproject will also return a point in `[x, y]` format.
- The following lines need to be removed from `assets/css/qwc2.css`:

      -input[type=range] {
       -    display: initial!important;
       -    width: initial!important;
      -}
- The `assets/css/qwc2.css` stylesheet is now empty by default
- Some color keys in `styleConfig.js` have changed
- The bootstrap stylesheet in `index.html` is not used anymore and can be removed
- All icons are now built into a custom icon font, replacing the svgs in `assets/img` and the bootstrap glyphicons used previously. Applications will need to be updated as follows:
  * Add the toplevel icons folder from qwc2-demo-app to your app (the svgs in `assets/img` are not used anymore)
  * The icons in `menuItems`and `toolbarItems` in `config.json` now only need to contain the icon name, not the relative svg path. So i.e. `img/themes.svg` becomes `themes`.
  * The font rule needs to be added to `webpack.config.js`:

        +      {
        +        test: /\.(woff|woff2)(\?\w+)?$/,
        +        use: {
        +          loader: "url-loader",
        +          options: {
        +            limit: 50000,
        +            mimetype: "application/font-woff",
        +            name: "fonts/[name].[ext]",
        +          }
        +        }
        +      }
  * `package.json` needs to be updated with the new dependencies, and the `iconfont` script.
