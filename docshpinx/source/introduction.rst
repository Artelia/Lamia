What is pyqtgraph?
------------------

PyQtGraph is a graphics and user interface library for Python that provides
functionality commonly required in engineering and science applications. Its
primary goals are 1) to provide fast, interactive graphics for displaying data
(plots, video, etc.) and 2) to provide tools to aid in rapid application
development (for example, property trees such as used in Qt Designer).

PyQtGraph makes heavy use of the Qt GUI platform (via PyQt or PySide) for its
high-performance graphics and numpy for heavy number crunching. In particular,
pyqtgraph uses Qt's GraphicsView framework which is a highly capable graphics
system on its own; we bring optimized and simplified primitives to this
framework to allow data visualization with minimal effort.

It is known to run on Linux, Windows, and OSX
