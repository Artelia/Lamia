#GOVERNANCE
The project is managed by a comitee meeting every three weeks and composed by membres of Artelia Group. 
They reflect both the commercial and development related progresses of the project.
The most important decisions regarding the development of LAMIA are taken during those sessions. 
The decisions of lesser importance are taken during private discussions between Patrice Verchère and Valentin Anjou.  

Anyone commited to helping LAMIA make progress is welcomed to take part to this meetings. 

To this day, the comitee is composed of : 
	Patrice Verchère
	Marc Poloniato
	Guillaume Barjot
	Arielle Masson
	Laurent Tavernier
	Valentin Anjou
