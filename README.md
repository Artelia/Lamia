# Lamia

Welcome to the project LAMIA !

# GOAL

Our goal is to help people construct coherent and robust databases that can live through the years so that they can develop a strong knowledge of their asset and switch from a destruction/reconstruction approach to an asset managment one. 
The ultimate goal is to reduce the cost of the maintenance of the most important assets such as dykes, roads and bridges, while dramatically reducing their ecological impact. 

# AUDIANCE
We aim at providing the public and private sectors with an easy-to-use tool to collect, store and maintain high-quality data on their linear infrastructures.
